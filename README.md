Tool for computing momentum budget:

Westerly wind burst is one of the defining characteristics of the MJO, but its origin remains unclear. This tools enables us to conduct a detail study of the generation of low-level westerly wind burst observed during the DYNAMO MJO events. For this analysis, ECMWF operational analyses dataset is utilized.
