Tool for computing momentum budget:

Westerly wind burst is one of the defining characteristics of the MJO, but its origin remains unclear. This tools enables us to conduct a detail study of the generation of low-level westerly wind burst observed during the DYNAMO MJO events. For this analysis, ECMWF operational analyses dataset is utilized. Along with Oh et al (2015b, to be submitted), these source codes will faciliate the reproducibility of Oh et al (2015a).
